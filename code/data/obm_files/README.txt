This subdirectory is meant to exemplify how OBM files are stored.

A given FIS may have had multiple folders (each corresponding to a different recording on the same machine). If just one folder for a given FIS was present, the folder's name was "FISXXX"; if there were multiple, the folders' names were "FISXXXa", "FISXXXb", "FISXXXc", etc. The current code was built to handle the case where, in a given FIS's folders, there were numerous subdirectories, the key ones being called "CrossEeg", "LeftEeg" and "RightEeg" (note how FIS number was not mentioned in these folders). Within each was found at least 2 EDF files: an original (which contained simply the folder name + .edf; e.g., "CrossEeg.edf") and at least one exported EDF file. The exported EDF files had the name of f"{fis_folder_name}{subfolder_name}{n}", where n is always an integer, starting at 1, expressed with 4 digits. For example, if we are looking at the first exported EDF in the CrossEeg folder of the folder FIS201a, the file name of that EDF file must be "FIS201a_CrossEeg_0001.edf". The next would be "FIS201a_CrossEeg_0002.edf", etc.
